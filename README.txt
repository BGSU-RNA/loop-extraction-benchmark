notes:  To download the results I set up the query as shown in the
'Query setup screenshot.jpeg', then extracted the links from the
'Download results' section of the results page (see
file 'Results screenshot.jpeg'), put them in the file 'results_links.html' and
used Sitesucker program to automatically follow these links.
