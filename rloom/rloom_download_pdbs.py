"""

Download pdb files from a results html page generated by the RLooM webserver.
It's necessary to download the pdbs in order to further process them in matlab.
RLooM uses its own internal indexes to describe loops, so one has to perform a
geometric FR3D search to match them to their original nucleotides.
